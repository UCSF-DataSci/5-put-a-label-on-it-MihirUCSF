MODEL COMPARISON RESULTS
========================================
Random Forest AUC: 0.9947
XGBoost AUC: 1.0000

COMPARISON SUMMARY
========================================
Absolute difference in AUC: 0.0053
Percent improvement: 0.53%
Best performing model: XGBoost

FEATURE ENGINEERING INSIGHTS
========================================
Adding time-series features (rolling mean and standard deviation)
allowed the models to capture temporal patterns in heart rate data,
potentially improving their predictive performance compared to
models using only static features.
