NOTES
==================================================
This model was trained on data resampled with SMOTE to address class imbalance.
The model was evaluated on the original imbalanced test set to ensure realistic performance assessment.
Categorical feature 'smoker_status' was encoded using one-hot encoding with 'drop=first' strategy.
